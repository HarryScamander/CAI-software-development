# CAI-software-development
【Functional requirements】

1. Implement a small arithmetic game CAI software system with a friendly interface design (good human-computer interaction), easy operation, and help primary school students perform four arithmetic operations on one-digit (elementary) or two-digit (advanced) numbers.

2. The main interface gives the rules of the game, prompting primary school students to choose any of the four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to challenge. At the beginning of the game, two numbers (one-digit numbers) appear randomly on the screen, prompting primary school students to give answers. If the answer is wrong, they are asked to re-enter the answer. There are only 5 chances to answer each question. After the chances are used up, they will directly move on to the next question.

3. Count the scores. After reaching a certain score value (e.g., 95 points or above), you can advance to the next level, that is, challenge yourself with double-digit calculations. Similarly, you can set an upper limit on the number of test questions (e.g., 50 questions in total). If you fail to pass the test after completing 50 questions, you can remind them to "study hard."

4. Related knowledge points: process-oriented structured programming ideas, sub-function design, menu design, branch/loop structure design, application of random function rand(), application of program end function exit(), application of screen clearing function, etc.

5. Provide program testing solutions. The strength of program functions may vary from person to person, but the program must withstand the test of various test data.

Note: If the difference is negative or cannot be divided exactly, skip to the next question.
